            <p>Hedwig was Harry Potter's pet snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus). Hedwig was an 11th birthday gift from Rubeus Hagrid to Harry. Hagrid purchased her at Eeylops Owl Emporium. In addition to the usual use Owls are put to, delivering mail, Hedwig was also a close companion to Harry. She remained one of his closest friends right up to her death during the Battle of the Seven Potters at the height of the Second Wizarding War.</p>

            <p>Well, the only appearance of this rare breed of bird was on a recurring television commercial for Tootsie Roll’s Tootsie Pops. A young boy approached an elderly turtle with an absurd philosophical dilemma. Perhaps it was a complex metaphor for some oblique political issue, or perhaps a Zarathustrian flight of poetic fancy, but the boy asked the turtle how many licks it would take to reach the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie pop. The turtle proclaims that he does not know, as he has always bitten through the hard candy shell. The turtle recommends that the boy ask Mr. Owl. Mr. Owl is eager to help, and decides to use the scientific approach to the dilemma by licking the Tootsie Pop himself. He counts three of his licks before he – perhaps unconsciously – bites the candy and swallows it whole. He returns the candy stick to the boy, and the boy leaves dejected.</p>

            <P>Owl from Winnie the Pooh is considered a bit of a know-it-all, though his friends in the Hundred Acre Wood always seek his advice. Unfortunately, he often misses the mark.</P>

            <p>Duo is the official mascot of Duolingo. It is a green owl of an unknown species and is meant to symbolize knowledge, wisdom and learning. In Duolingo it can at times serve as a coach to motivate users to achieve higher learning goals, and can also instruct users on several aspects of the Duolingo website.</p>
